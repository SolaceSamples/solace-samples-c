# Getting Started Examples
## Solace C API

The "Getting Started" tutorials will get you up to speed and sending messages with Solace technology as quickly as possible. There are three ways you can get started:

- Follow [these instructions](https://cloud.solace.com/create-messaging-service/) to quickly spin up a cloud-based Solace messaging service for your applications.
- Follow [these instructions](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-VMR-Set-Up/Setting-Up-VMRs.htm) to start the Solace VMR in leading Clouds, Container Platforms or Hypervisors. The tutorials outline where to download and how to install the Solace VMR.
- If your company has Solace message routers deployed, contact your middleware team to obtain the host name or IP address of a Solace message router to test against, a username and password to access it, and a VPN in which you can produce and consume messages.

## Contents

This repository contains code and matching tutorial walk throughs for the basic Solace messaging patterns. For a nice introduction to the Solace API and associated tutorials, check out the [tutorials home page](https://dev.solace.com/samples/solace-samples-c/).

## Prerequisites ##

On Linux/Mac
- gcc compiler

On Windows
- Visual Studio 2008 and above. (Tested on VS2008/2010/2013/2015)  
  (**Note:** To build 64-bit sample apps, please make sure that the x64 compiler is installed)
- VS2008 redistributable installed. (For non-static build)

## Checking out and Building

To check out the project and build it, do the following:

  1. `git clone` this GitHub repository
  2. `cd solace-samples-c`
 
### Build the Samples

1. `cd build`  

2. On Linux:  
```
    build$ ./build_intro_linux_xxx.sh
```
3. On Mac:
```
    build$ ./build_intro_mac_xxx.sh
```
4. On Windows, you can either build the source code from Visual Studio IDE or from DOS command prompt.   
To build from the IDE, you will need to go to `build\intro\win\VS2008` and double-click on `intro.sln`.  
To build from DOS prompt, you must launch the appropriate Visual Studio Command Prompt and then run the `build_intro_win_xxx.bat`

### Running the Samples

To try individual samples, build the project from source and then run samples like the following:

1. `cd ../bin`

2. On Linux:
```
    bin$ . ./setenv.sh
    bin$ ./TopicPublisher
```

3. On Mac and Windows, you can run the sample app straight-away.
