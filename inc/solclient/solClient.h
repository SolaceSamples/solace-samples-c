     @section introduction Introduction

     The Messaging API for C provides an Application Programming
     Interface (API) for developing C or C++ applications for use with a Solace messaging appliance.

     @section overview Overview

     The Messaging API for C (also referred to as SolClient) is specifically designed to 
	 provide high message throughput and low latency with the lowest CPU utilization
     possible. It is a fully functional API, and it contains the following
     main features:
     @li Allows the application to connect to a Solace messaging appliance through the concept of a "Session".
     @li Allows messages to be constructed and sent on a Session and to be received from a Session.
     @li Allows subscriptions to be added to specify what messages are to be received. Subscriptions are
     topic-based and require the use of a Solace messaging appliance with a Topic Routing Blade (TRB).
     @li Support for Guaranteed Message delivery (Queue-based or Topic Endpoint-based).
     Guaranteed messages are received on "Flows" (see solClient_session_createFlow()), which are 
	 constructed within a Session. Guaranteed Messaging is only available to clients when a Solace messaging appliance
	 is used that has an Assured Delivery Blade (ADB) installed and Guaranteed Messaging and message 
	 spooling enabled.
     @li Allows fine-tuning of API behavior, such as whether operations should be blocking or non-blocking in nature.
     @li Allows for the option of application file descriptors to be monitored within the API, providing
	 the application with callbacks for readable and writable events.
     @li Allows for the option of the application taking over control of file descriptors created within the API to
     connect to the Solace messaging appliance, where the application must provide readable and writable events to the API.
     @li Support for timer services.
     @li Support for logging, including support for logging filter levels, and the ability for the application to
     be called back for generated logs so that they can be placed into the application's logging system.

     @section specifics Messaging API for C Specifics

     The Messaging API for C behavior is unique among Solace Corporation Messaging APIs in 
	 the following ways:

     @subsection threading-support Threading Support

     By default, the Messaging API for C does not provide any internal threads. Instead, the 
	 API allows the application to provide thread processing time, providing more 
	 flexibility to application designers on how to allocate messaging system resources. 
	 However, SolClient can optionally provide a Context thread for processing work that 
	 is suitable for the most common application models and architectures.

     @subsection blocking-non-blocking Blocking and Non-Blocking Modes

     These modes are handled differently for the Messaging API for C than with the Messaging API for
     Java. For the Messaging API for C, blocking mode means that the calling thread for each send()
     function call is blocked until the API can accept the message. As a result, the application
     automatically controls the flow of send() calls to a rate at which the appliance can accept them. The send()
     function call remains blocked until either it is accepted by the API, or the timer (specified by
     ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_BLOCKING_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS) expires.

     In non-blocking mode, send() function calls that cannot be accepted by the API immediately return a
     ::solClient_returnCode ::SOLCLIENT_WOULD_BLOCK error code to the application. 
     If the application receives a ::SOLCLIENT_WOULD_BLOCK error, then 
     it also receive a subsequent ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_EVENT_CAN_SEND event.
     The application can then retry the send()
     function call. In the interim, it can continue to process other actions.

     @subsection blocking-context Threading Effects on Blocking Modes

     The thread that is responsible for calling solClient_context_processEvents() is commonly referred to as
     the Context thread. Whether this thread is provided by SolClient, or a separate application thread, there are
     blocking implications that the application developer must be aware of. All callbacks from the API to the application,
     message receive callbacks, event callback, and timer callbacks, run from the Context thread. Additionally the Context
     thread must run to detect relief from flow control and unblock waiting application threads. The Context thread 
     must run to complete the Session connection sequence and unblock applications waiting for connection complete. The
     Context thread must run to unblock applications waiting for confirmation on subscription requests.

     Consequently, applications must not block in callback routines. Waiting in callback routines can deadlock the application 
     or at a minimum severely degrade receive performance. Deferring SolClient processing by running for excessively long 
     periods of time in the callback routines will prevent SolClient from unblocking other application threads that might be 
     waiting for confirmation of sent messages or be blocked in flow control situations. 
     
     SolClient detects when an application re-enters the API from a callback and will never block. Consequently, applications
     can expect to see ::SOLCLIENT_FAIL return codes when making SolClient function calls from a callback routine,
     if the function call would be blocking in other threads. Generally, if a function could block because of TCP flow control, 
     ::SOLCLIENT_FAIL is returned when that function is called from a callback, if the Session property 
     ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_SEND_BLOCKING is enabled.  This will only occur if the session finds it is flow controlled at
     the socket (TCP).  If it is possible to send the message, the function call will succeed as usual.  If the Session property 
     ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_SEND_BLOCKING is disabled, the API will succeed or return SOLCLIENT_WOULD_BLOCK as expected.

     
     Further, if the application explicitly sets ::SOLCLIENT_SUBSCRIBE_FLAGS_WAITFORCONFIRM
     on a subscribe or unsubscribe API call made from a callback routine, that function call will return ::SOLCLIENT_FAIL 
     and set the subcode to ::SOLCLIENT_SUBCODE_CANNOT_BLOCK_IN_CONTEXT. Similarly, a function call on modifyClientInfo API made from a callback 
     will return ::SOLCLIENT_FAIL (with the subcode ::SOLCLIENT_SUBCODE_CANNOT_BLOCK_IN_CONTEXT) when the flag 
     ::SOLCLIENT_MODIFYPROP_FLAGS_WAITFORCONFIRM is set explicitly by the application.

     @subsection message-buffer Message Buffer Size Configuration

     The Session buffer size configured using the ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_BUFFER_SIZE
     Session property controls SolClient buffering of transmit messages. When sending 
     small messages, to improve the performance, the Session buffer size should be set 
	 to multiple times the typical message size. Regardless of
     the buffer size, SolClient always accepts at least one message to transmit. 
     So even if a single message exceeds ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_BUFFER_SIZE, it 
     is accepted and transmitted as long as the current buffered data is
     zero. However no more messages are accepted until the amount
     of data buffered is reduced enough to allow room below 
     ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_BUFFER_SIZE.

     SolClient will internally buffer up to ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_BUFFER_SIZE 
     bytes on transmit. This buffering is dynamic and does not consume memory 
     when not in use.
     
     @section topic-syntax Supported Topic Syntax
     Topics are NULL-terminated UTF-8 strings in the form "level1/level2/level3".
     The total length of a Topic can be 250 bytes, not including the NULL terminator.
     
     @section subscription-syntax Supported Subscription Syntax
     Subscriptions are in the form "level1/level2/level3". \n
     The total length of a subscription can be 250 bytes. \n
     The '>' character, when alone at the final level of a subscription,
     means match one or more levels at the end of a received topic. For example, "level1/level2/level3/>"
     matches "level1/level2/level3/level4" and "level1/level2/level3/level4/level5", but not
     "level1/level2/level3". \n
     '>' elsewhere in the subscription has no special meaning. For example, "level1>/level2".
     
     @subsection trb-subscription Supported Subscription Syntax with a Topic Routing Blade (TRB) in the Appliance
     The '*' character is a wildcard. When alone at a level, it means match any string at that level
     in a received topic. For example, "level1/ * /level3" matches "/level1/level2/level3". \n
     '*' can also be used to match a level that starts with a specified string. \n
     For example "level1/lev* /level3" matches "/level1/level2/level3". \n
     A '*'cannot appear at the beginning or within a string. For example, "lev*1" and "*evel" are not valid.
     
     @section topic-dispatch Dispatching Messages Based on a Topic
     By default, when subscriptions are added, all messages are dispatched to the Session message
     receive callback that is defined when the Session is created (through the ::solClient_session_createFuncInfo_t 
     parameter of ::solClient_session_create). However, a Session can also be configured through the Session
     property ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_TOPIC_DISPATCH to dispatch messages with specific 
     Topic destinations to a message receive callback that is specified when a Topic subscription is added
     ( ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch()). Dispatching/demultiplexing incoming messages 
     based on the Topic associated with the message allows different callbacks to be 
     invoked based on the received topic. It also allows different application data to be provided to 
     the callback based on the matching subscription. Full wildcard subscription syntax is supported
     (refer to @ref subscription-syntax).
     
     As an example, consider the following Topic dispatch descriptions: \n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t dispatch1 = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallback1Func, &item1Data, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t dispatch2 = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallback1Func, &item2Data, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(
             session_p, 0, "level1/item1", &dispatch1, NULL ); \n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(
             session_p, 0, "level1/item2", &dispatch2, NULL); \n
     
     When a message is received with Topic "level1/item1", msgCallback1Func is called with
     a pointer to the application's item1Data structure.
     When a message is received with Topic "level1/item2", msgCallback1Func is called with
     a pointer to the application's item2Data structure.
     A Topic dispatch subscription is uniquely identified by the tuple <subscription, callback_p, 
     user_p, NULL (reserved for future use)>, any number of message callback functions can be used.
     
     When Topic dispatching is enabled, the Session callback is still used for subscriptions that
     are created through ::solClient_session_topicSubscribe() or ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeExt, but
     only if no other callback has been invoked for a received message. So the Session callback acts as a "default" callback. For example, consider what occurs when the following subscription is added to the preceding example: \n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeExt(
             session_p, 0, "level1/>");
     
     The application subscribes to all topics under level1, but "level1/item1" and "level1/item2" go
     to the msgCallback1Func callback with the specified user_p, while any other Topic starting with "level1/" 
     go to the default Session message callback. This allows an application to trap certain topics 
     to a specified callback and send others to the Session callback.
     
     If a message matches subscriptions that use the Topic dispatch Session callback, then each matching
     subscription invokes a callback, and the application can receive and process a message 
     multiple times. For example: \n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t dispatchA = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallbackAFunc, &userDataA, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t dispatchB = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallbackBFunc, &userDataB, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t dispatchC = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallbackCFunc, &userDataC, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(
             session_p, 0, "part1/item1", &dispatchA, NULL); \n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(
             session_p, 0, "part1/item1", &dispatchB, NULL); \n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(
             session_p, 0, "part1/>", &dispatchC, NULL); \n
     
     In this example, when a message arrives with Topic "part1/item1", it is delivered to
     each of the msgCallbackAFunc, msgCallbackBFunc, and msgCallbackCFunc callback functions. When a message 
     arrives with the Topic "part1/item2", it is only delivered to the msgCallbackCFunc
     callback function. Note that when a message does not match a specific callback and is being delivered
     to the default Session message received callback, it is only delivered once to that callback, 
     independent of the number of subscriptions it matched.

     Each unique Topic subscription is also added to the Solace messaging appliance and removed when there are 
     no longer any dispatch functions associated with the subscription. Applications that want to have 
     fine-grained control over appliance resources may choose to add dispatch Session callback functions only without 
     adding a subscription to the appliance. When the @ref subscribeflags "subscription flag" 
     ::SOLCLIENT_SUBSCRIBE_FLAGS_LOCAL_DISPATCH_ONLY is set, the subscription is not added to the appliance. For example:\n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t dispatchA = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallbackAFunc, &userDataA, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t dispatchB = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallbackBFunc, &userDataB, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t dispatchC = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallbackCFunc, &userDataC, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(
             session_p, SOLCLIENT_SUBSCRIBE_FLAGS_LOCAL_DISPATCH_ONLY, "part1/item1", &dispatchA, NULL); \n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(
             session_p, SOLCLIENT_SUBSCRIBE_FLAGS_LOCAL_DISPATCH_ONLY, "part1/item2", &dispatchB, NULL); \n
         ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch( session_p, 0, "part1/>", &dispatchC, NULL); \n
    
    In this example, the application avoids adding the subscriptions for "part1/item1" and "part1/item2" to the appliance as
    these subscriptions overlap with the wildcard subscription "part1/>". All messages are forwarded to the application due
    to the last wildcard subscription, and properly dispatched by the more specific non-wildcard subscriptions.
     
     When unsubscribing, a specified callback can be removed through ::solClient_session_topicUnsubscribeWithDispatch().
     For example: \n
         ::solClient_session_rxMsgDispatchFuncInfo_t removedispatchA = {SOLCLIENT_DISPATCH_TYPE_CALLBACK,  msgCallbackAFunc, &userDataA, NULL };\n
         ::solClient_session_topicUnsubscribeWithDispatch( session_p, 0, "part1/item1", &removedispatchA, NULL);

     Note:  When unsubscribing the pointer to the dispatch information (&removedispatchA) does not have to exactly match the pointer used
     to create the Topic dispatch entry, but the contents must describe the entry to be removed.
     
     The interface ::solClient_session_topicUnsubscribe() or ::solClient_session_topicUnsubscribeExt()
     can only be used to remove subscriptions for the default Session callback. When calling
     ::solClient_session_topicUnsubscribeWithDispatch(), providing a NULL pointer for the callback and the 
     user pointer or providing a NULL pointer to the dispatch information is equivalent to calling solClient_session_topicUnsubscribeExt().

     <b>
     @subsection host-entry Configuring Host Entry for SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_HOST property
     </b>
     
     The entry for the SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_HOST property should provide a protocol, host, and port. The SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_HOST 
     property may also include an optional Proxy Server configuration, separated from the message router configuration by a percent (\%) 
     sign.

    @li [Protocol:]Host[:Port][\%ProxyService] or [Protocol://]Host[:Port][\%ProxyService]

    Protocol is the protocol used for the transport channel. The valid values are: \n
     @li tcp - use a TCP channel for communications between the application and its peers. If no protocol is set, tcp is used as a default.\n
     @li tcps - use a SSL channel over TCP for communications between the application and its peers.\n
     @li http - use HTTP channels or a WebSocket channel over TCP for communications between the application and its peers. Web Messaging with compression is not supported. \n
     @li https - use HTTP channels or a WebSocket channel over SSL for communications between the application and its peers. Web Messaging with compression is not supported.
  
    Host is the IP address (or host name) to connect to for a connection. 

    Port is the port to connect to for a connection. A value is only required when using a port other than the automatically assigned 
    default port number. The default port for TCP is 55555 when compression is not in use, or 55003 when compression is in use. The default port 
    for SSL is 55443. The default port for HTTP or WebSocket over TCP is 80. The default port for HTTP or WebSocket over SSL is 443.

    ProxyService is a description of the non-transparent proxy.  If it is necessary to configure the proxy server that is used to connect to
    the message router, then the proxy server is configured in the ProxyService string. The ProxyService string format is specified as:

    @li [ProxyProtocol]://[username:password@]proxyHost[:proxyPort]

    ProxyProtocol is the protocol used to communication with the proxy server. The valid values are:\n
     @li socks5 - Connect to the server with the SOCKS Protocol Version 5, RFC 1928 (IETF Standards Track Document) 
     @li httpc -  Connect to the server with the HTTP Connect Protocol, RFC 2817 (IETF Standards Track Document)

    If authentication is required for the proxy server, the <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> may be optionally 
    specified before the proxy host.

    proxyHost is the IP address (or host name) of the proxy server. 

    proxyPort is the port to connect to for a connection. If the port number is not specified, the default for SOCKS5 is port 1080, and
    the default for Http-Connect is port 3128.

    The following examples show how to specify transport channel types. Unless it is otherwise specified, the default port 55555 is used. \n
     @li 192.168.160.28 - connect to IP address 192.168.160.28 and the default port 55555 over TCP. \n
     @li tcp:192.168.160.28 - connect to IP address 192.168.160.28 and the default port 55555 over TCP. \n
     @li tcps:192.168.160.28 - connect to IP address 192.168.160.28 and the default port 55443 over SSL over TCP.\n
     @li tcp:192.168.160.28:44444 - connect to IP address 192.168.160.28 and port 44444 over TCP. \n
     @li http&nbsp;://192.168.160.28 - connect to IP address 192.168.160.28 and the default port 80 over HTTP or WebSocket over TCP. \n
     @li https&nbsp;://192.168.160.28 - connect to IP address 192.168.160.28 and the default port 443 over HTTP or WebSocket over SSL over TCP.

    The following examples show how to connect to a message router through a proxy server.\n
     @li 192.168.160.28\%socks5://192.168.1.1 - connect to message router at 192.168.160.28 through a SOCKS5 proxy server at 192.168.1.1.\n
     @li 192.168.160.28\%httpc://192.168.1.1 - connect to message router at 192.168.160.28 through a HTTP-Connect proxy server at 192.168.1.1.\n
     @li tcps:solace.company.com\%socks5://User:PassWord\@proxy.company.com:13128 - connect to message router at solace.company.com using
         SSL over TCP through a SOCKS5 proxy server at proxy.company.com, port 13128. Authenticate with the proxy server using username <I>User</I>
         and password <I>PassWord</I>.
     @li http&nbsp;://192.168.160.27:44444\%httpc://proxy.company.com:11080 - connect to the message router at 192.168.160.28, port 44444, using HTTP.
         Connect through the proxy server at proxy.company.com, port 11080.

     The SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_HOST property also supports multiple host entries separated by comma. 

     @subsection host-list Configuring Multiple Hosts for Redundancy and Failover

     You can provide up to sixteen potential hosts for a client application 
     to connect or reconnect to. Typically the listed appliances are in separate geographic 
     locations, and the use of a host list allows your client applications to fail over to the
     alternate connections should the first appliance be unavailable. The host
     list is configured in the ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_HOST property as a comma-separated list 
     of hosts. Each host may optionally include a port number
     as well. For example, if there are two appliances at 192.168.160.128 and
     192.168.160.129, but the second is using the non-default port 50005 for the
     message bus, the ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_HOST would be configured as: \n
        "192.168.160.128,192.168.160.129:50005".

    If a client application publishes Guaranteed messages  (send flags of 
    ::SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_PERSISTENT or ::SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_NONPERSISTENT) in a Session, and
    then a disconnect occurs, the API will automatically reconnect to other
    listed hosts. However, because another host will not know the state of the publisher flow
    to the original host, the API must reset publisher flow state.  Unacknowledged messages are 
    renumbered and resent by the API.  If the alternate router is configured as a replication site this
    may lead to duplicate messages in the system.  It is up to the application to resolve this duplication
    in what ever way is appropriate to the application.

    Applications may wish to configure the session so that auto-reconnect only occurs if no guaranteed 
    messages have been published. This is the legacy behaviour of the API. If this is desired then 
    set the session property ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_GD_RECONNECT_FAIL_ACTION to the value 
    ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_GD_RECONNECT_FAIL_ACTION_DISCONNECT.  This session property can also be
    set as environment variable which then allows legacy applications to run without modification or
    recompile.

    In the given example, with the ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_HOST configured as: \n
        "192.168.160.128,192.168.160.129:50005"\n
    when solClient_session_connect() is called, SolClient will attempt to
     connect, first to 192.168.160.128. If that connection fails for any
     reason, it will attempt to connect to 192.168.160.129:50005. This process is
     repeated until all entries in the host list are attempted. After each entry
     has been attempted, and if all fail, the Session properties ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_CONNECT_RETRIES
     and ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_RECONNECT_RETRY_WAIT_MS determine the behavior of
     SolClient. If ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_CONNECT_RETRIES is non-zero, SolClient
     waits for up to the number of milliseconds set for ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_RECONNECT_RETRY_WAIT_MS
	 then starts a connection attempt again from the beginning of the list.

     If an established Session fails, to any host in the list, when 
     ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_RECONNECT_RETRIES is non-zero, then SolClient automatically attempts
     to reconnect, starting at the beginning of the list.
     
     The Session connect timer, ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS, runs separately for
     each connection attempt. So an application waiting for a connection established 
     (::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_EVENT_UP_NOTICE) or connection failure 
     (::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_EVENT_CONNECT_FAILED_ERROR) may have to wait up to 
     (<<i>number of hosts in list</i>> times ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS) for the event.
     
     @subsection flow-topic-dispatch Dispatching Messages Based on a Topic for a Flow
     
     Topic dispatching is also available on Flows to Queues and Topic Endpoints.
     
     A Queue endpoint Flow may have many topics associated with it. Topics may be added to Queue 
     endpoint Flows with the Session function, solClient_session_endpointTopicSubscribe(), or with the
     Flow function, solClient_flow_topicSubscribeWithDispatch().  
     
     A Topic Endpoint Flow only has a single Topic which is defined when the Flow is created
     (see ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_TOPIC). Topic dispatching for a Topic Endpoint Flow can be
     useful when the Flow's Topic contains wildcards because the Topic dispatching capability can
     then be used to separate out different topics covered by the Flow's wildcard topic.

     As with solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(), the @ref subscribeflags "subscribe flag"
     ::SOLCLIENT_SUBSCRIBE_FLAGS_LOCAL_DISPATCH_ONLY may be used on a 
     Queue endpoint Flow to add a dispatch callback entry only.  ::SOLCLIENT_SUBSCRIBE_FLAGS_LOCAL_DISPATCH_ONLY is
     implied on a Topic Endpoint Flow as adding topics dynamically to a Topic Endpoint is not supported. 

     solClient_flow_topicSubscribeWithDispatch() can be used to add a Topic subscription only (no dispatch entry)  to the Queue 
     endpoint by setting the dispatch information to NULL.
     
     Similar to a Session, Topic dispatching on a Flow is controlled by the functions
     ::solClient_flow_topicSubscribeWithDispatch() and ::solClient_flow_topicUnsubscribeWithDispatch().
     Note that for a Topic Endpoint the ::solClient_flow_topicSubscribeWithDispatch() and ::solClient_flow_topicUnsubscribeWithDispatch() functions only control the dispatching of messages received on the Flow and do 
     not affect which messages are received on the Flow. The only property that controls the messages
     received on a Flow to a Topic Endpoint is ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_TOPIC.  
     
     No check is made to ensure that any Topic subscribed to through ::solClient_flow_topicSubscribeWithDispatch()
     is actually received on the Topic Endpoint Flow. For example, if the Topic Endpoint Flow was created with Topic 'level1/>',
     if ::solClient_flow_topicSubscribeWithDispatch() is invoked with a Topic of 'level2/level3', that topic
     is accepted, but the callback for that Topic is never invoked as the Flow will not attract
     messages that match that topic.
     
     @section feature-limitations Feature Limitations

     The routing of messages according to their defined Topics can only be used with Solace messaging appliances running
     Version 4.3 or above, and the appliance must be equipped with a Topic Routing Blade (TRB).
     In addition, the application description property of a Session only takes effect
     in this configuration, but it can be set without any side-effects with earlier
     release appliances or appliances without a TRB.

     The quality of service parameter (part of the flags field of solClient_session_send())
     is only supported when client mode is enabled on a Session. Otherwise, the quality
     of service parameter is ignored.

     File descriptor limits in Linux and Solaris operating systems restrict the
     number of files that can be managed per process to 1024. Because of these
     limitations due to the use of select(2) to poll devices, the Messaging 
     API for C may not manage any single file descriptor which has a numerical 
     value that exceeds 1024.
     
     If the C API is used in an application that connects to a Solace messaging appliance 
     with a Topic Routing Blade (TRB), channel connect failures can occur 
	 if there are more than 1024 Sessions created per process. This limit is 
	 further reduced by any other files not managed by the C API that the 
	 application has open.

     Similarly, on Windows platforms, a single Context (see solClient_context_create()) 
	 cannot manage more than 21 Sessions with pubSub mode enabled (clientMode==0) or 64 
     Sessions in client mode (clientMode==1). Exceeding these limits can 
     cause calls to \link ::solClient_context_processEvents 
     solClient_context_processEvents()\endlink to fail. An application that 
     registers its own file descriptor handlers (by providing non-null 
     function pointers in ::solClient_context_createRegisterFdFuncInfo_t) is not
     limited in the Messaging API for C, but the application might have its own limitations.  

     In all systems, an application that provides its file descriptors to the 
	 C API to manage (by calling solClient_context_registerForFdEvents())
     further reduces the number of Sessions that can be handled in a 
     single Context (Windows) or process-wide (Linux, Solaris).
     
     @subsection certificate-validation OpenSSL Certificate Validation

     <strong>Note on certificate validation:</strong>

     When validating certificates, the messaging APIs for C and .NET use the
     following validation rules, after building the chain from the server
     certificate to a self-signed root certificate using certificates presented by
     the server and certificates in the trust store :

     - Verify the root certificate is trusted.
     - Verify depth of the chain is <= 3.

     Java and JMS messaging APIs use the same rules as C and .NET with the following
     exceptions:
     - Depth validation is not enforced in Java or JMS.
     - When the server presents an incomplete certificate chain, Java/JMS messaging
     APIs only require the signer of the incomplete certificate chain to be in the
     trust store, where this could be insufficient for C/.NET APIs.

     Therefore C and .NET messaging APIs certificate validation rules are more
     restrictive, hence if a certificate is accepted by C or .NET, it will
     definitely be accepted by Java and JMS.

     @section transacted-session Transacted Session
     Client applications can create one or more transacted sessions within a non-transacted session.
     The lifecycle of a transacted session is bounded by the lifecycle of its non-transacted parent session.
     In other words, when a session is destroyed/disposed, all transacted sessions created within this session
     will be destroyed/disposed too.
     A transacted session can have at most one publisher flow and zero or many subscriber flows.
     All messages sent/received by a transacted session must have a guaranteed delivery mode, 
     there is no support for direct transport messages.

     <strong>Message Dispatcher:</strong> 

     Asynchronous message delivery to client applications within a Transacted Session (i.e. message consumers
     created from Transacted Sessions) cannot happen over the context thread. Therefore, asynchronous message
     delivery within a Transacted Session will be done within an implicitly created Message Dispatcher. \n
     There are two types of Message Dispatchers, which client applications can choose when a Transacted Session is created.

     @li Context-bound: A Message Dispatcher lazily created by the Context. 
     A Context can have at most one context-bound Message Dispatcher.
     @li TransactedSession-bound: A Message Dispatcher lazily created by a Transacted Session. 
     
     The lifecycle of a message dispatcher is bounded to the lifecycle of the corresponding API object.
     There are advantages and disadvantages when using TransactedSession-bound message dispatchers. 

     @li The main advantage is improved responsiveness. It is also possible to improve application performance, 
     especially with multi-core processors.
     @li The main disadvantage is that programing and debugging is more complex as 
     applications must be more multi-thread aware. In environments where there is 
     contention for CPU resources, there is more overhead managing and switching between threads.
     
     <strong>Receiving Messages:</strong>
     
     The main differences between receiving messages from a transacted consumer Flow and from a non-transacted Flow are:
     
     @li For a transacted consumer Flows (created by a Transacted Session), function solClient_flow_sendAck() returns OK
     and no operation (NOP) is performed.
     @li If a Rx message callback is provided when a transacted consumer Flow is created, messages received on the flow
     are dispatched to the callbacks with the usual user_p just as on non-transacted Flows, but in the  context of an 
     internal Contex-bound or TransactedSession-bound Message Dispatcher thread.
     @li For transacted Flows created without Rx message callbacks, messages received on Flows are queued internally. 
     Applications must call function ::solClient_flow_receiveMsg directly to retrieve messages from those internal queues.
     
     <strong>Publishing Messages:</strong>
     
     To publish guaranteed messages on a Transacted Session, Transacted Session property 
     ::SOLCLIENT_TRANSACTEDSESSION_PROP_HAS_PUBLISHER must be enabled when the Transacted Session is created.
     
     The main differences between publishing guaranteed messages from a Transacted Session and from a Session are:
     
     @li For a Transacted Session, window Size has no effect.
     @li For a Transacted Session, messages are not retransmitted.
     @li For a Transacted Session, a successful commit acknowledges published messages.
     @li For a Transacted Session, ACKs and NACKs from the appliance are ignored.
     
     <strong>Multithreading:</strong>
     
     Transacted Sessions are not thread-safe and a single Transacted Session should not 
     be accessed by multiple application threads.  
     The legal use cases for a transacted session, which are not enforced by the API, are limited to:
     @li If messages are received by Rx message callbacks, invoke commit/rollback/sendMsg only from 
     receiving message callbacks (i.e. in the context of an internal Message Dispatcher thread). 
     @li If messages are received from an application thread by calling ::solClient_flow_receiveMsg() 
     directly, commit/rollback/sendMsg/receiveMsg functions must be called in the context of the 
     same application thread.

 * can significantly reduce end-to-end latency on message delivery.
 * 
 * However, applications must be aware that the message store operation
 * may have not succeeded. The publisher application may be notified of a publishing failure when the subscribing application successfully 
 * receives the message.  This can lead to duplication if the publishers chooses to resend the failed message.  It also means that there is
 * no guarantee that a received message is available in persistent store on endpoint. So if a receiving applications chooses to discard the 
 * received message, unbinding (::solClient_flow_destroy())  and rebinding (::solClient_session_createFlow()) to the Flow is not guaranteed to
 * redeliver the discard message such as would be the case in ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_FORWARDING_MODE_STORE_AND_FORWARD mode.
 *
 * Further, ordering and delivering requirements place further limits on the use of ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_FORWARDING_MODE_CUT_THROUGH. 
 * A Session may have only one ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_FORWARDING_MODE_CUT_THROUGH configured Flow. With one Flow in 
 * this mode, the same Session can support any number of parallel Flows that do <b>not</b> set 
 * ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_FORWARDING_MODE_CUT_THROUGH (that is, in the default forwarding mode, ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_FORWARDING_MODE_STORE_AND_FORWARD).

*
* These functions are used when the application wants to own event generation, and they supply
* file descriptor events to the API. Such applications typically want to poll several different devices, of
* which the API is only one. When these functions are provided, the API does not manage its own 
* devices. Instead, when a device is created, the provided 'register' function is called to register the 
* device file descriptor for read and/or write events. It is the responsibility of the application to call back 
* into API when the appropriate event occurs on the device file descriptor. The API callback is 
* provided to the register function (see ::solClient_context_registerFdFunc_t). If this interface is chosen,
* the application <b>must</b> also call solClient_context_timerTick() at regular intervals.
*
* Normally these are not used, and the API owns event registrations. If an internal Context thread is used 
* by enabling ::SOLCLIENT_CONTEXT_PROP_CREATE_THREAD  (see also ::SOLCLIENT_CONTEXT_PROPS_DEFAULT_WITH_CREATE_THREAD),
* the API takes care of all devices and timers and no action is required by the application. If the internal thread is
* not enabled, the application must call solClient_context_processEvents() to provide scheduling time to the API.
* 
* When the API owns event registrations, it also provides file descriptor register/unregister service to the application. 
* solClient_context_registerForFdEvents() and solClient_context_unregisterForFdEvents() can be used by applications to 
* pass file descriptors to the API for managing, keeping event generation localized to the internal thread or the thread
* that calls solClient_context_processEvents().

/**
* Creates a new Context. The @ref ContextProps "context properties" are supplied as an array of

* property names starting with "CONTEXT_" are processed; other property names
* are ignored. Any values not supplied are set to default values.
* Passing in NULL causes all Context
* properties to be set to their default values.
*
* It is highly recommended that applications should always use an automatically created internal context 
* thread. Passing in ::SOLCLIENT_CONTEXT_PROPS_DEFAULT_WITH_CREATE_THREAD
* causes the Context to have the context thread created automatically and all other Context properties at
* their default value. Alternatively, an internal thread can be created by enabling ::SOLCLIENT_CONTEXT_PROP_CREATE_THREAD.
*
* If an external context thread  (the default for historical reasons) is needed under special circumstances, 
* the application must supply a thread to do the work on
* behalf of a Context. The application does this by having a Context thread call solClient_context_processEvents(). In some rare cases, application can also use an optional file descriptor event service.
*  Applications can register
* application file descriptors for events using solClient_context_registerForFdEvents(). The file descriptor event callback routine that has
* been registered is invoked by the Context thread when the event occurs.
*
* As an alternative, the application can provide the file descriptor event registration mechanism itself, which then
* results in the API using the application-provided events. To activate this mode, the application must provide file descriptor event
* register and deregister function at the time of Context creation (see ::solClient_context_createRegisterFdFuncInfo). If the register/deregister function
* pointers provided are NULL, then the internal API event mechanism is used. When the application is providing events to the API,
* solClient_context_processEvents() must not be called. Instead solClient_context_timerTick() must be called on regular basis as
* API timers are dependent on this function which is usually invoked during solClient_context_processEvents().
* 
*
* When the Context is created, an opaque Context pointer is returned to the caller, and this value 
* is then used for any Context-level operations, such as creating a Session.
*
* Note that the property values are stored internally in the API, and the caller does not have to maintain

*
* <b>Special Buffering of Guaranteed Messages</b>\n
* Guaranteed messages (::SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_PERSISTENT or ::SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_NONPERSISTENT) are 
* assured by the protocol between the client and the Solace message router.  To make developers' task easier, 
* guaranteed messages are queued for delivery in many instances:
* @li While transport (TCP) flow controlled.
* @li While message router flow controlled.
* @li While sessions are connecting or reconnecting.
* @li While sessions are disconnected or down.
*
* The C-SDK will buffer up to a publishers window size (::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_PUB_WINDOW_SIZE) of guaranteed messages before 
* solClient_session_sendMsg() will either block (when ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_SEND_BLOCKING is enabled) or return ::SOLCLIENT_WOULD_BLOCK
* (on active sessions) or return ::SOLCLIENT_NOT_READY (on disconnected sessions).
*
* For the most part this is desired behavior. Transient sessions failures do not require special handling in applications. When

* application does not need to concern itself with special handling for the transient reconnecting state.

* Specifying a NULL funcInfo_p or if funcInfo_p references a NULL  dispatchCallback_p and a NULL dispatchUser_p makes this function
* act the same as ::solClient_session_topicUnsubscribeExt(). Used in this manner, an application can set the correlationTag which appears in asynchronouus confirmations (::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_EVENT_TE_UNSUBSCRIBE_OK). Setting correlationTag is not available when using 
* ::solClient_session_topicUnsubscribeExt().
* 
* Usually this API is used to provide a separate callback and user pointer for messages received on the given topic.
* The Session property ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_TOPIC_DISPATCH must be enabled for a non-NULL callback to be
* specified. When funcInfo_p is non-NULL and a dispatchCallback_p is specified, the callback pointer and dispatchUser_p are removed
* from an internal callback table. funcInfo_p does not have to match the funcInfo_p used in ::solClient_session_topicSubscribeWithDispatch(). However,
* the contents referenced in funcInfo_p must match an entry found in the callback table.

 * will block until the amount of time set for the timeout parameter expires and then return
 * ::SOLCLIENT_INCOMPLETE with subcode ::SOLCLIENT_SUBCODE_TIMEOUT.

 * is delivered to the replyTo destination as a receive message callback with the response attribute set -
 * solClient_msg_isReplyMsg() returns true. It is entirely within the responsibility of the

 * If replyMsg_p is non-NULL, this functions returns an opaque message pointer (::solClient_opaqueMsg_pt) in the location
 * referenced by replyMsg_p. This message is allocated by the API and contains the received reply. This function allocates
 * the message on behalf of the application and the application <b>must</b> later release the message by calling
 * solClient_msg_free(replyMsg_p).
 *
 * The API only allows one blocking request (timeout non-zero) at a time. If a multiple threaded application calls 
 * solClient_session_sendRequest() from multiple threads at the same time, the first processed request is sent and
 * all other requests block until the first response is received, then the next request is sent. This will consume
 * some of the timeout period for each request.

/**
* Creates a new Flow within a specified Session. Flow characteristics and behavior are defined by Flow properties. The Flow properties
* are supplied as an array of name/value pointer pairs, where the name and value are both strings.
* \ref flowProps "FLOW" and \ref endpointProps "ENDPOINT" configuration property names are processed; other property names
* are ignored. If the Flow creation specifies a non-durable endpoint, ENDPOINT properties can be used to change the default 
* properties on the non-durable endpoint. Any values not supplied are set to default values.
*
* When the Flow is created, an opaque Flow pointer is returned to the caller, and this value is then used for any
* Flow-level operations (for example, starting/stopping a Flow, getting statistics, sending an acknowledgment).
* The passed-in structure functInfo_p provides information on the message receive callback
* function and the Flow event function which the application has provided for this Flow.
* Both of these callbacks are mandatory. The message receive callback is invoked for each
* received message on this Flow. The Flow event callback is invoked when Flow events
* occur, such as the Flow going up or down. Both callbacks are invoked in the context
* of the Context thread to which the controlling Session belongs.
*
* Flow creation can be carried out in a blocking or
* non-blocking mode, depending upon the Flow property
* ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_BIND_BLOCKING.
* In blocking mode, the calling thread is blocked until the Flow connection attempt either
* succeeds or is determined to have failed. If the connection succeeds, ::SOLCLIENT_OK is
* returned, and if the Flow could not be connected, ::SOLCLIENT_NOT_READY is returned.
* In non-blocking mode, ::SOLCLIENT_IN_PROGRESS is returned upon a successful Flow create
* request, and the connection attempt proceeds in the background.
* In both a non-blocking and blocking mode, a Flow event is generated for the Session:
* ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_EVENT_UP_NOTICE, if the Flow was connected successfully; or
* ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_EVENT_BIND_FAILED_ERROR, if the Flow failed to connect.
* For blocking mode, the Flow event is issued before the call to
* solClient_session_createFlow() returns. For non-blocking mode, the timing is undefined (that is,
* it could occur before or after the call returns, but it will typically be after).
* A Flow connection timer, controlled by the Flow property
* ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_BIND_TIMEOUT_MS, controls the maximum amount of
* time a Flow connect attempt lasts for. Upon expiry of this time,
* a ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_EVENT_BIND_FAILED_ERROR event is issued for the Session.
* If there is an error when solClient_session_createFlow() is invoked, then ::SOLCLIENT_FAIL
* is returned, and a Flow event is not subsequently issued. Thus, the caller must
* check for a return code of ::SOLCLIENT_FAIL if it has logic that depends upon a subsequent
* Flow event to be issued.
* For a non-blocking Flow create invocation, if the Flow create attempt eventually
* fails, the error information that indicates the reason for the failure cannot be
* determined by the calling thread. It must be discovered through the Flow event
* callback (and solClient_getLastErrorInfo can be called in the Flow event callback
* to get further information).
* For a blocking Flow create invocation, if the Flow create attempt does not
* return ::SOLCLIENT_OK, then the calling thread can determine the failure reason by immediately
* calling solClient_getLastErrorInfo. For a blocking Flow creation, ::SOLCLIENT_NOT_READY is returned
* if the created failed due to the bind timeout expiring (see ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_BIND_TIMEOUT_MS).
* Note that the property values are stored internally in the API and the caller does not have to maintain
* the props array or the strings that are pointed to after this call completes. The API does not modify any of
* the strings pointed to by props when processing the property list.
*
* If the flow property SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_BIND_ENTITY_ID is set to ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_BIND_ENTITY_TE, 
* the flow Topic property ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_TOPIC <b>must</b> be set, which will replace any existing
* topic on the topic-endpoint.
*
* <b>WARNING:</b> By default the ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_ACKMODE is set to ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_ACKMODE_AUTO,
* which automatically acknowledges all received messages. Function ::solClient_flow_sendAck returns SOLCLIENT_OK
* in the mode ::SOLCLIENT_FLOW_PROP_ACKMODE_AUTO, but with a warning that solClient_flow_sendAck
