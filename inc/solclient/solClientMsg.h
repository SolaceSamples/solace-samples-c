* @section solclientmsg Solace Message Buffers
*
* Solace Message Buffers provide clients with
* controlled buffer management. Applications that use
* Solace Message Buffers must first allocate a message buffer with 
* \link ::solClient_msg_alloc solClient_msg_alloc()\endlink. This returns an
* opaque pointer to a Solace message buffer that must be released by the
* application when it is finished with the message. Message buffers are 
* released by calling \link ::solClient_msg_free solClient_msg_free().\endlink
* 
* Applications are responsible for releasing all message buffers they allocate by
* solClient_msg_alloc() or solClient_msg_dup(). Message buffers received by
* callback are owned by the API and <b>must not</b> be released. However the
* application may also take ownership of these message buffers by returning 
* ::SOLCLIENT_CALLBACK_TAKE_MSG on return from the receive message callback
* function. If the application returns ::SOLCLIENT_CALLBACK_TAKE_MSG, it
* <b>must</b> call solClient_msg_free() to release the message when it is
* finished with the message buffer.
* 
* Message buffers 
*
*
* The Message Buffer API provides functions to manipulate the common Solace
* message header fields that are optionally sent in the binary metadata 
* portion of the Solace message. 
* Applications can also use the structured data API to add containers 
* (maps or streams) and their fields to the binary payload or to the User Property
* map contained within the binary metadata.
*
* This does not prevent applications from ignoring these 
* functions and treating these payloads as an opaque binary field for
* end-to-end communications.
*
* The Solace common binary header fields that may be set/read by this message buffer API are:
*
* @li ReplyTo - a ReplyTo destination.
* @li SenderId - a Sender Identification. This field can be automatically generated when 
*                the session property 
*                ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_GENERATE_SESSION_ID is enabled. When
*                this property is enabled, and the SenderId is not explicitly
*                set, the session ClientName is used as the SenderId.
* @li Application MsgType - a string for an application specific MsgType.
* @li Application MessageId - a string for an application-specific Message Identifier.
* @li Sequence Number  - a 64-bit application Sequence Number, set by Publisher.
*                This field may be automatically generated when the session property
*                ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_GENERATE_SEQUENCE_NUMBER is 
*                enabled. When this property is enabled, and the Sequence 
*                Number is not explicitly set, a unique and increasing sequence
*                number is generated for each sent message.
* @li CorrelationId - a string for an application-specific correlation tag.
* @li Send Timestamp - a 64-bit field set by the Publisher. This field may be
*                automatically generated when the session property
*                ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_GENERATE_SEND_TIMESTAMPS 
*                is enabled in the sending API.
* @li Receive Timestamp - a read-only field inserted by the receiving API when the
*                session property ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_GENERATE_RCV_TIMESTAMPS 
*                is enabled in the receiving API.
*
* @section encoding-overhead Encoding Overhead of Data Types in Streams and Maps
* The overhead of a stream or a map structure is 5 bytes, plus the 
* contents of the stream or map.
* The list below shows the overhead of various data types when added to a stream or map.
* When adding to a map, the overhead is the overhead of the type to be stored, plus the
* overhead of the string field name. The overhead of the string field name is the same
* as the overhead shown below for a string value.
* @li null - 2 bytes
* @li ::solClient_bool_t - 3 bytes
* @li char - 4 bytes
* @li ::solClient_wchar_t - 4 bytes
* @li ::solClient_int8_t or ::solClient_uint8_t - 3 bytes
* @li ::solClient_int16_t or ::solClient_uint16_t - 4 bytes
* @li solClient_int32_t or solClient_uint32_t - 6 bytes
* @li ::solClient_int64_t or ::solClient_uint64_t - 10 bytes
* @li float - 6 bytes
* @li double - 10 bytes
* @li byte array - number of bytes in byte array plus: 
*                  2 if # bytes <= 253; 
*                  3 if # bytes <= 65552; 
*                  4 if # bytes <= 16777211,
*                  5 otherwise
* @li string - string length plus: 
*              3 if string length <= 252; 
*              4 if string length <= 65551; 
*              5 if string length <= 16777210,
*              6 otherwise
* @li ::solClient_destination_t - string length of destination plus:
*                                 4 if string length <= 251; 
*                                 5 otherwise
* @li SMF message - same as byte array
*
* If a stream is added to the binary payload of a message, and the 
* stream contains a ::solClient_int16_t and a ::solClient_int64_t, the stream
* size will be 19 bytes (5 bytes for the stream overhead, 4 bytes for the 
* ::solClient_int16_t, and 10 bytes for the ::solClient_int64_t).
*
* If a map is added to the binary payload of a message, and the map
* contains an entry of type ::solClient_int16_t with a field name
* of "FirstFieldName" and an entry of type ::solClient_int8_t with a field name of 
* "SecondFieldName", the map will be 47 bytes (5 bytes for the map overhead,
* 17 bytes for the first field name string, 4 bytes for the ::solClient_int16_t value,
* 18 bytes for the second field name string, and 3 bytes for the ::solClient_int8_t
* value).
 *
 * @section msgMaps Solace Structured Data Maps
 *
 * Solace structured data maps (::solClient_msg_createBinaryAttachmentMap(), 
 * ::solClient_container_createMap(), solClient_msg_createUserPropertyMap())
 * provide the programmer with a structure whose members can be directly 
 * accessed by name. Programmers familiar with a hashMap will find the same 
 * concepts in a Solace structured data map. There is one notable exception -
 * Solace structured data maps do not detect duplicate key names on 'add'. If a 
 * field is added to the map with a key name that already exist, both fields will 
 * be present in the map. Only one field can be retrieved by that key name and it 
 * is not defined which field will be retrieved.
 *
 * Solace maps have been designed for efficient construction and transmission.
 * The maps can be read fastest by iterating over the map using 
 * solClient_container_getNextField(). If each field in a map is retrieved 
 * by name instead, the read time for the whole map is order independent.
 *
 * The key name field in Solace maps is case sensitive.  For example, adding 
 * a field with the name key "field_1" and a field with name key "FIELD_1" will 
 * create two distinct fields that can both be retrieved.
 *
 * @section adConsiderations Using Solace Message Buffers for Guaranteed messages
 * Solace messages buffers can be used to hold Guaranteed messages. You can call the 
 * accessor ::solClient_msg_setDeliveryMode() to set one of the following delivery
 * modes:
 * @li ::SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_DIRECT
 * @li ::SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_PERSISTENT
 * @li ::SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_NONPERSISTENT
 *
 * The default mode of any message is ::SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_DIRECT for the
 * fast reliable delivery (not Guaranteed), known as Direct Delivery. 
 *
 * To provide the best possible latency and throughput, the C API does 
 * <b>NOT</b> copy the contents of the message.
 * The message contents are maintained internally,
 * exactly as presented to ::solClient_session_sendMsg(), until the message 
 * is acknowledged by the Solace Messaging Appliance. In the event that a message needs to
 * be recovered by retransmission, the contents are seamlessly redelivered.
 *
 * This means the application must ensure that the message buffer's
 * contents remain untouched until notified by the session event callback 
 * that the message has been acknowledged. When sending a Guaranteed
 * message, the application must not modify any data referenced by the message,
 * until the ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_EVENT_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT is received. This is 
 * essential for applications that set message buffer parts by pointer 
 * (::solClient_msg_setBinaryAttachmentPtr, ::solClient_msg_setUserDataPtr, 
 * ::solClient_msg_setXmlPtr, ::solClient_msg_setTopicPtr, and
 * ::solClient_msg_setQueueNamePtr). When the application memory is used to 
 * hold message parts it <b>must not</b> be modified before the message is 
 * acknowledged. If the C API manages all memory in the message, it may be 
 * modified but the application will pay a performance penalty to do so.
 *
 * The message correlation tag is provided as a convenient location for an 
 * application to store stateful information. A pointer to the data with the 
 * correlation tag field is returned to the application with the 
 * ::SOLCLIENT_SESSION_EVENT_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT event. A typical application can
 * set the correlation tag pointer to its own memory for later retrieval of the 
 * message pointer to free. For example:
 *
 * @code
 *      struct myData {
 *          solClient_msg_pt    msg_p;
 *      } *myData_p;
 *      solClient_msg_alloc(&myData_p->msg_p);
 *      solClient_msg_setDeliveryMode(msg_p, SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_PERSISTENT);
 *
 *      // set up message attachments, etc. here
 *
 *      solClient_msg_setCorrelationTagPtr(msg_p, myData_p, sizeof(*myData_p));
 *      solClient_msg_sendMsg(msg_p);
 *
 *      //  ....
 *      // session event callback handler for 
 *      // SOLCLIENT_SESSION_EVENT_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
 *      
 *      struct myData *myData_p = (struct myData *) eventInfo_p->info_p;
 *      solClient_msg_free(&myData_p->msg_p);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Of course it is expected that your application will appropriately check the
 * ::solClient_returnCode_t for each C API call and handle exceptions.
