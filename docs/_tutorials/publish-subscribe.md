This tutorial will introduce you to the fundamentals of the Solace API by connecting a client, adding a topic subscription and sending a message matching this topic subscription. This forms the basis for any publish / subscribe message exchange.

## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes the following:

*   You are familiar with Solace [core concepts]({{ site.docs-core-concepts }}){:target="_top"}.
*   You have access to Solace messaging with the following configuration details:
    *   Connectivity information for a Solace message-VPN
    *   Enabled client username and password

{% if jekyll.environment == 'solaceCloud' %}
One simple way to get access to Solace messaging quickly is to create a messaging service in Solace Cloud [as outlined here]({{ site.links-solaceCloud-setup}}){:target="_top"}. You can find other ways to get access to Solace messaging on the [home page]({{ site.baseurl }}/) of these tutorials.
{% else %}
One simple way to get access to a Solace message router is to start a Solace VMR load [as outlined here]({{ site.docs-vmr-setup }}){:target="_top"}. By default the Solace VMR will with the “default” message VPN configured and ready for guaranteed messaging. Going forward, this tutorial assumes that you are using the Solace VMR. If you are using a different Solace message router configuration adapt the tutorial appropriately to match your configuration.

## Goals

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the most basic messaging interaction using Solace. This tutorial will show you:

1.  How to build and send a message on a topic
2.  How to subscribe to a topic and receive a message

{% if jekyll.environment == "solaceCloud" %}
  {% include solaceMessaging-cloud.md %}
{% else %}
  {% include solaceMessaging.md %}
{% endif %}  
{% include solaceApi.md %}

## Connecting to the Solace message router

In order to send or receive messages, an application must connect a Solace session. The Solace session is the basis for all client communication with the Solace message router.

In the Solace messaging API for C (SolClient), a few distinct steps are required to create and connect a Solace session.

*   The API must be initialized
*   Appropriate asynchronous callbacks must be declared
*   A SolClient Context is needed to control application threading
*   The SolClient session must be created

### Initializing the CCSMP API

To initialize the SolClient API, you call the initialize method with arguments that control logging.

```cpp
/* solClient needs to be initialized before any other API calls. */
solClient_initialize ( SOLCLIENT_LOG_DEFAULT_FILTER, NULL );
```

This call must be made prior to making any other calls to the SolClient API. It allows the API to initialize internal state and buffer pools.

### SolClient Asynchronous Callbacks

The SolClient API is predominantly an asynchronous API designed for the highest speed and lowest latency. As such most events and notifications occur through callbacks. In order to get up and running, the following basic callbacks are required at a minimum.

```cpp
static int msgCount = 0;

solClient_rxMsgCallback_returnCode_t
messageReceiveCallback ( solClient_opaqueSession_pt opaqueSession_p, solClient_opaqueMsg_pt msg_p, void *user_p )
{
    printf ( "Received message:\n" );
    solClient_msg_dump ( msg_p, NULL, 0 );
    printf ( "\n" );

    msgCount++;
    return SOLCLIENT_CALLBACK_OK;
}

void
eventCallback ( solClient_opaqueSession_pt opaqueSession_p,
                solClient_session_eventCallbackInfo_pt eventInfo_p, void *user_p )
{  
    printf("Session EventCallback() called:  %s\n", solClient_session_eventToString ( eventInfo_p->sessionEvent));
}
```

The messageReceiveCallback is invoked for each Direct message received by the Session. In this sample, the message is printed to the screen.

The eventCallback is invoked for various significant session events like connection, disconnection, and other SolClient session events. In this sample, simply prints the events. See the [SolClient API documentation]({{ site.docs-api-ref }}){:target="_top"} and samples for details on the session events.

### Context Creation

As outlined in the core concepts, the context object is used to control threading that drives network I/O and message delivery and acts as containers for sessions. The easiest way to create a context is to use the context initializer with default thread creation.

```cpp
/* Context */
solClient_opaqueContext_pt context_p;
solClient_context_createFuncInfo_t contextFuncInfo = SOLCLIENT_CONTEXT_CREATEFUNC_INITIALIZER;

solClient_context_create ( SOLCLIENT_CONTEXT_PROPS_DEFAULT_WITH_CREATE_THREAD,
                           &context_p, &contextFuncInfo, sizeof ( contextFuncInfo ) );
```

### Session Creation

Finally a session is needed to actually connect to the Solace message router. This is accomplished by creating a properties array and connecting the session.

```cpp
/* Session */
solClient_opaqueSession_pt session_p;
solClient_session_createFuncInfo_t sessionFuncInfo = SOLCLIENT_SESSION_CREATEFUNC_INITIALIZER;

/* Session Properties */
const char     *sessionProps[50];
int             propIndex = 0;
char *username,*password,*vpnname,*host;

/* Configure the Session function information. */
sessionFuncInfo.rxMsgInfo.callback_p = messageReceiveCallback;
sessionFuncInfo.rxMsgInfo.user_p = NULL;
sessionFuncInfo.eventInfo.callback_p = eventCallback;
sessionFuncInfo.eventInfo.user_p = NULL;

/* Configure the Session properties. */
propIndex = 0;
host = argv[1];
vpnname = argv[2];
username = strsep(&vpnname,"@");
password = argv[3];

sessionProps[propIndex++] = SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_HOST;
sessionProps[propIndex++] = host;

sessionProps[propIndex++] = SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_VPN_NAME;
sessionProps[propIndex++] = vpnname;

sessionProps[propIndex++] = SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_USERNAME;
sessionProps[propIndex++] = username;

sessionProps[propIndex++] = SOLCLIENT_SESSION_PROP_PASSWORD;
sessionProps[propIndex] = password;

/* Create the Session. */
solClient_session_create ( ( char ** ) sessionProps,
                           context_p,
                           &session_p, &sessionFuncInfo, sizeof ( sessionFuncInfo ) );

/* Connect the Session. */
solClient_session_connect ( session_p );
printf ( "Connected.\n" );
```

When creating the session, the factory method takes the session properties, the session pointer and information about the session callback functions. The API then creates the session within the supplied context and returns a reference in the session pointer. The final call to solClient_session_connect establishes the connection to the Solace message router which makes the session ready for use.

At this point your client is connected to the Solace message router. You can use SolAdmin to view the client connection and related details.

## Receiving a message

This tutorial is uses "Direct" messages which are at most once delivery messages. So first, let's express interest in the messages by subscribing to a Solace topic. Then you can look at publishing a matching message and see it received.  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pub-sub-receiving-message-300x134.png)

With a session connected in the previous step, then you must subscribe to a topic in order to express interest in receiving messages. This tutorial uses the topics "tutorial/topic".

```cpp
solClient_session_topicSubscribeExt ( session_p,
                                    SOLCLIENT_SUBSCRIBE_FLAGS_WAITFORCONFIRM,
                                      "tutorial/topic");
```

Then after the subscription is added, the consumer is started. At this point the consumer is ready to receive messages. So wait in a loop for the expected message to arrive.

```cpp
printf ( "Waiting for message......\n" );
fflush ( stdout );
while ( msgCount < 1 ) {
    sleepInSec ( 1 );
}
```

## Sending a message

Now it is time to send a message to the waiting consumer.  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pub-sub-sending-message-300x134.png)

To send a message, you must create a message and a topic destination. This tutorial will send a Solace binary message with contents "Hello world!". Then you must send the message to the Solace message router.

```cpp
/* Message */
solClient_opaqueMsg_pt msg_p = NULL;ss
solClient_destination_t destination;
const char *text_p = "Hello world!";

/* Allocate memory for the message that is to be sent. */
solClient_msg_alloc ( &msg_p );

/* Set the message delivery mode. */
solClient_msg_setDeliveryMode ( msg_p, SOLCLIENT_DELIVERY_MODE_DIRECT );

/* Set the destination. */
destination.destType = SOLCLIENT_TOPIC_DESTINATION;
destination.dest = "tutorial/topic";
solClient_msg_setDestination ( msg_p, &destination, sizeof ( destination ) );

/* Add some content to the message. */
solClient_msg_setBinaryAttachment ( msg_p, text_p, ( solClient_uint32_t ) strlen ( (char *)text_p ) );

/* Send the message. */
printf ( "About to send message '%s' to topic '%s'...\n", (char *)text_p, argv[4] );
solClient_session_sendMsg ( session_p, msg_p );

printf ( "Message sent. Exiting.\n" );
solClient_msg_free ( &msg_p );
```

In the SolClient API, messages are allocated and freed from an internal API message pool for greatest performance and efficiency. Therefore as shown, messages must be acquired by calls to solClient_msg_alloc and then later freed back to the pool by calls to solClient_msg_free.

The minimum properties required to create a SolClient message that can be sent is to set the delivery mode, queue or topic destination, and message contents as shown in the above code. Once the message is created it is sent to the Solace message router with a call to solClient_session_sendMsg.

At this point the producer has sent a message to the Solace message router and your waiting consumer will have received the message and printed its contents to the screen.

## Summarizing

The full source code for this example is available in [GitHub]({{ site.repository }}){:target="_blank"}. If you combine the example source code shown above results in the following source:

<ul>
{% for item in page.links %}
<li><a href="{{ site.repository }}{{ item.link }}" target="_blank">{{ item.label }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

The OS source code simply provides platform abstraction. The subscriber sample makes use of this for the sleep in the main loop.

### Building

Building these examples is simple. The following provides an example using Linux. For ideas on how to build on other platforms you can consult the README of the C API library.

```
gcc -g -Wall -I ../include -L ../lib -lsolclient -lpthread HelloWorldPub.c -o HelloWorldPub
gcc -g -Wall -I ../include -L ../lib -lsolclient -lpthread os.c HelloWorldSub.c -o HelloWorldSub
```

Referencing the downloaded SolClient library include and lib file is required. For more advanced build control, consider adapting the makefile found in the "Intro" directory of the SolClient package. The above samples very closely mirror the samples found there.

If you start the HelloWoldSub with  the required arguments of your Solace messaging, it will connect and wait for a message.

```
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./HelloWorldSub <host:port> <client-username@message-vpn> <client-password>
HelloWorldSub initializing...
Session EventCallback() called:  Session up
Connected. Awaiting message...
```

Then you can send a message using the HelloWorldPub with the same arguments. If successful, the output for the producer will look like the following:

```
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./HelloWorldPub <host:port> <client-username@message-vpn> <client-password>
HelloWorldPub initializing...
Session EventCallback() called:  Session up
Connected. About to send message 'Hello world!' to topic 'tutorial/topic'...
Message sent. Exiting.
```

With the message delivered the subscriber output will look like the following:

```
Received message:
Destination:         Topic 'tutorial/topic'
Class Of Service:    COS_1
DeliveryMode:        DIRECT
Binary Attachment:   len=12
48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21           Hello world!
Exiting.
```

The received message is printed to the screen. The message contents was "Hello world!" as expected and shown in the contents of the message dump along with additional information about the Solace message that was received.

If you have any issues sending and receiving a message, check the [Solace community]({{ site.links-community }}){:target="_top"} for answers to common issues seen.

You have now successfully connected a client, subscribed to a topic and exchanged messages using this topic.
